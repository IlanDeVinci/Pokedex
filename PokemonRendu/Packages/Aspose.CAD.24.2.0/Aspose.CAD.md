Please visit [Aspose.CAD for .NET 24.2 - Release Notes](https://releases.aspose.com/cad/net/release-notes/2024/aspose-cad-for-net-24-2-release-notes/) for the detailed notes.


## Functionality
- Provides comprehensive document import and export with 35+ [supported file formats](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/net/supported-file-formats/). This allows developers to [convert documents from one file format to another](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/net/converting-file-formats/). For example, you can convert DXF to DWG and DWG to DXF documents with professional quality.
- Contains a flexible mechanism for working with files, namely: [reading, updating and writing](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/net/how-to/work-with-file/read-update-and-write-dwg-file/), and also provides the ability to [create CAD files](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/net/how-to/generate-file/generation-of-dxf/) separately.
- Provides the ability to work with text, [extract all text](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/net/how-to/work-with-text/extract-all-text/) from an drawing or [adjust it by changing](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/net/how-to/work-with-text/ability-to-superimpose-and-adjust-text-on-dwf-images/) position, [size](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/net/how-to/work-with-text/adjust-text-size-for-dxf-dwg/) and visibility, as well as [work with fonts]((https://docs.aspose.com/cad/net/how-to/work-with-fonts/substitute-fonts/)) separately
- Provides a flexible variety of capabilities, such as [adjusting drawing element line lengths](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/net/how-to/work-with-entities/change-lines-weight-for-dwg-dxf/), [exporting these components to multiple PNG files](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/net/how-to/work-with-layout/export-each-layout-in-separate-png-file/), [removing certain entities](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/net/how-to/remove-of-an-entity/) and easily editing a large number of distinct entities and more.. Thanks to its extensive toolkit, users may precisely and customise their images and designs.
- Provides the ability to work with 3D files, including [change the observation point](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/net/how-to/work-with-3d-file/change-observation-point-for-3d-scenes/) and [supports mtl files when exporting](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/net/how-to/work-with-3d-file/support-for-mtl-files-on-obj-export/) files to OBJ format.
- Provides the ability to [insert DXF/DWG drawings into DWG](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/net/how-to/insert-dxf-dwg-drawing-inside-dwg/)/[DXF](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/net/how-to/insert-dxf-dwg-drawing-inside-dxf/).

```

## Export of DWG to PDF with drawing color change using C#

```csharp
Image img = Image.Load("Drawing.dwg");
MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();

var rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 500;
rasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 500;
rasterizationOptions.Layouts = new string[] { "Model" };
rasterizationOptions.DrawColor = Color.Red;

var pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

img.Save("output.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

## Generate DXF drawing from scratch and its conversion to PNG using C#

```csharp
DxfImage img = new DxfImage();

CadLine line = new CadLine(new Cad3DPoint(0, 0, 0), new Cad3DPoint(100, 100, 100));
img.AddEntity(line);

CadText text = new CadText();
text.FirstAlignment = new Cad3DPoint(0, -50, 0);
text.TextHeight = 10;
text.DefaultValue = "text value";
img.AddEntity(circle);

CadCircle circle = new CadCircle(new Cad3DPoint(50, 0), 10);
img.AddEntity(circle);

var rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 256;
